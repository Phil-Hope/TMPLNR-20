            <div class="card-body">
                <strong>JWT</strong>
                <p>For the authentication of users I have utilized JSON Web Tokens with the aid of the
                    <a href="https://github.com/lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle">Lexik JWT Authentication bundle</a>
                    <br />
                    By utilizing JWT I am able to send my front end with a RS256 encoded token which includes the necessary information needed to
                    authenticate the user with each request. The JWT includes the user UUID as well as the users roles (ROLE_USER or ROLE_ADMIN).
                </p>
                <p>To utilize this package to its full potential I have created 3 event listener classes:
                    <ul>
                <li>AuthenticationFailureResponse.php
                <br />
                    This will send the front end a customized error upon the attempted use of an invalid JWT.
                </li>
                <li>AuthenticationSuccessListener.php
                <br />
                This was added to customize which content was to ne included in the JWT payload.
                </li>
                <li>JWTCreatedListener.php
                <br />
                    This was implemented to include the IP address of the client in the payload which is then checked
                    upon each time it is used.
                </li>
            </ul>
                </p>
                <strong>Argon2i Password Encryption</strong>
                <p>For this application I have implemented Argon2i as the encoding method for all users.</p>
                <p>To ensure that the users password is encrypted each time a new user is created and when a user changes their password,
                I have created a Data Persister class: UserDataPersister.php
                <br />
                This is similar to an event listener class except that it alters the data before it is stored in the database.
                    In this case, it listens for any event where the user has created or edited a password and changes the string value to the encoded value
                    before saving it in to the database. This prevents any string values for passwords being stored in the database.

                    <p>Simply by adding @ApiResource to the DOC Block above the entity class it then exposed all the CRUD endpoints needed.</p>
                    <p>Including POST, GET (one), GET (all), PUT, PATCH and DELETE</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Api platform was able to offer so much more functionality then just this.</p>
                    <p>By using the @Groups annotation, I could group together what data from other entities that shared relation to show in my JSON requests.</p>
                    <p>Such as, for a scheduled shift, I can see the onDuty.firstName onDuty.lastName onDuty.id and so on.</p>
                    <p>This became extremely useful for expanding on how I could implement Angular's Routing through the front end of my app.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Another API Platform feature that was extremely useful was the @ApiFilter. With this I could add boolean types and filter by true or false. Which
                    was extremely useful for only shifts that have been approved by the manager or if a new message had been read or not.</p>

                    <strong>Doctrine ORM</strong>
                    <p>One of the great things using and ORM is that the back end knows exactly what type of data to expect before it interacts with the database.</p>
                    <p>With every attribute of every entity assigned the appropriate data type including whether it is nullable or not. In the annotations in the DOC Blocks I can also set
                    a maximum or minimum length for each attribute.</p>
                    <br />
                    <strong>Api Platform</strong>
                    <p>Api Platform also utilizes these annotation in the DOC Blocks and is the first point of validation against these data types.</p>
                    <p>Before any data is handled by Doctrine ORM and Doctrine DBAL, API-Platform checks the received JSON data against the configured data types.</p>

                    <p>By default it will save the JWT which I have coded to be split in to 3 separate values of data in the IndexedDB, if for some reason the default location does not work
                    it will be saved using WebSQL.</p>
                    <p>One field is the token value, which is sent with each request using a http.interceptor.ts file that I have created.</p>
                    <p>The other two are the user's uuid and the user's roles.</p>
                    <p>If a token is present, the app.component.ts which holds the main navigation will display the links that are only visible to a user once they have a JWT in their browser.</p>
                    <p>After login and the JWT is received, the user is redirected to the user profile where the payload value containing the user's UUID is used with the get request for the user's

                    expect in its forms with the necessary form fields.</p>
                    <p>In the services that utilized for HTTP requests, each form field is named against the already dictated data types in the interface classes.</p>

                    <p>As a means to provide a great visual tool for planning and approving shifts, I implemented this calendar twice.</p>
                    <p>One Calendar displays all shifts pending approval from the manager and the other is the official calendar showing approved shifts.</p>

                    <p>After mapping out the expected JSON structure and the data types of the entities that will be used in the HTTP requests, you
                    care able to make a HTTP request and Observable of that Entity Class. This meant that in any component, to have access to the http call, I only needed to subscribe
                    to it. It would then know if it should be one instance of the entity or an array of the entity.</p>
                    <p>This made the use of interpolation extremely easy.</p>
                    <strong>ngIF + ngFor</strong>
                    <p>The ngIf and ngFor functions that are built in to Angular are very useful and I have used them all through out my application.</p>
                    <p>With the ngFor, it is used to iterate through an array of json data.</p>
                    <p>The ngIf allowed for simple if statements directly in the html elements.</p>
                    <p>This was great for implementing the spinner for loading. As if the content was not there, else #loading for the ngTemplate that included the html for the spinner.

                    <p>There are 3 main sections where interacting with shifts takes place.</p>
                    <p>When you first login you are given I quick view of your upcoming approved shifts.</p>
                    <p>From your profile you can view all your personal shifts.</p>
                    <p>On this page I implemented some filters which are found at the top of the page.</p>
                    <p>There are 3 different filter buttons, one is for past shifts, all shifts, and upcoming shifts.</p>
                    <p>After pressing any of those buttons you get an action card appear from the bottom of the screen giving you a more details set of
                    options for filtering the shifts.</p>
                    <p>The Shifts dashboard displays all shifts. On this page you can also use a filter which is again located at the top of the page.</p>
                    <p>To create a shift, you can go to the create shift link located in the shifts dashboard.</p>
                    <p>In this area the onDuty field is filled in using your UUID which is stored in local storage.</p>
                    <p>Only the admin user is able to create shifts and assign it to an employee.</p>
                    <p>To edit a shift, you can either do this by clicking on a shift in the list containing your personal shift or if you are admin you can edit any ones shift.</p>
                    <p>Note that, if your shift is already approved and you are not admin, an admin user will have to be notified to have it changed.</p>
                    <p>To delete a shift, it is done the same by clicking on a shift in your personal shift list.</p>
                    <p>This is again, the same where only and admin user can delete a shift after its approval. And a user can only delete a shift that is belonging to them.</p>
                    <p>In the Admin section there are also some shift, this is very muuch similiar to the shifts dashboard except with some more visible information which is
                    suited for admin use.</p>
                    <p>All shifts are displayed on two separate calendars, Approved and Draft.</p>
                    <p>You can click the links on the calendar to navigate and vies the shift details, and from this screen you may edit if the shift belongs to you or if you
                    are admin. As well as delete with the same rules applying.</p>
                    <br />
                    <strong>Messaging</strong>
                    <p>To provide a tool to assist with how the team members can collaborate with each other and organize and better organize there scheduling.</p>
                    <p>I felt that adding personal messaging would be something to help this process.</p>
                    <p>In the navigation sidebar you will see a link for messaging.</p>
                    <p>When navigating to this page you view your unread messages.</p>
                    <p>When you open a message to read, I have created a put request the automatically updates the message to boolean "isRead" = true</p>
                    <p>From this page you can view all messages that you have sent and all read messages.</p>
                    <p>When sending a message, it performs a GET request for all users which populate the selection modal for choosing a recipient for the message.</p>
                    <p>The sender field is pre-populated by using the UUID from localstorage and the isPrivate value is set to true in a a hidden form field.</p>
                    <p>To prevent personal messages that have been linked to a shift appearing on the shift comments screen I added the boolean isPrivate as a
                    way to mitigate that from occurring.</p>
                    <p>To ensure that no inappropriate messaging is occurring, I have made a messaging page for admin, this includes all messages and shift comments.</p>
                    <p>This can also be used as a way to ensure that any information is accessible that may be sitting in a personal message box.</p>
                    <br />
                    <strong>Shift Comments</strong>
                    <p>This shares the same database table as the messaging content, but due to the once boolean field mentioned above, I was able to
                    make it work easily with both scenarios.</p>
                    <p>The objective that I had envisaged for shift comments, was to allow a note to be left on a specific shift. Because of the nature of the client scenario, which
                    is a on call support that operates world wide it would be extremely useful for a note to be left on the next persons shift to pick up where they left of for a customer issue
                    for example.</p>
                    <p>This can be created by clicking on the shift and clicking on the add comment button, you can choose to make someone the recipient or leave it blank.</p>
                    <p>Shift comments can only be edited by the author or by an admin user, this is also the same for deleting a shift comment.</p>
                    <p>These comments are set as cascade on update and delete, so if the shift is deleted then the comment is too.</p>
                    <br />
                    <strong>Users</strong>
                    <p>Due to the nature of how this app is intended to be used, I completely removed the registration page that I had originally created.</p>
                    <p>This is because no external user's should be able to register, rather if an employee will be anticipated to use the rostering app, then the manager will create
                    there login account for them.</p>
                    <p>After logging in the user can then change their password and update their user details.</p>
                    <p>In the profile page, there is a link that directs you to the change password form, and one for the changing your details.</p>
                    <p>Because the email and password is used to authenticate with backend with every request, I have made it so it automatically logs the user out and redirects to the login
                    page. This will then give the user the JWT with correct payload.</p>
                    <p>In the admin section you will find a users list page, from this you can edit or delete a user, view their upcoming shifts or send the user a message.</p>
